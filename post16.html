            <p>
                The objects used in the first test were small cylindrical pieces, with a diameter of 37mm. By using these small objects, it is possible to check the precision
                and accuracy of the process. Some of the pieces were placed in the workspace table with a
                inclination to force the manipulator to position itself with different Euler angles.
            </p>
            <p> 
              In the 20 tested pieces 6 of them were not successfully grabbed, which represents a percentage of success of 70%. This low percentage is caused by several easily visible problems: 
            </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Surface's Normal</li>
                  <p>
                      One cause of error is in the determination of the surface’s normal, which sometimes is not
                      properly computed. By positioning the end effector with the Euler angles computed with the
                      wrong surface’s normal, the suction cup will not be parallel to the object’s surface, thus not
                      allowing the object to be gripped, as in figure <b>1a</b>.
                    </p>
                    
                  <li>Centroid</li>
                  <p>
                    Since the Kinect has a low precision,
                    the centroid’s coordinates can vary up to 3mm from the correct centroid. In this specific test, this error
                    was not one of the reasons for not catching those 6 pieces, however the piece in figure <b>1b</b>
                    was almost not grabbed because of this, which means that objects smaller than the ones used
                    in this test could have failed more often because of this flaw.
                  </p>
                  <li>Laser Sensor Readings</li>
                  <p>
                      The main cause of error in the picking of objects derives from the oscillation
                      in the laser sensor readings. This, then, can cause two opposite situations, the tool tip could
                      be too far from the object when grabbing it, as in figure <b>1c</b>, but also too close, as in figure
                      <b>1d</b>. The piece in the last case was obviously grabbed but if it had been a more fragile object
                      it could have broken it.

                  In the second test, the objects used were ping pong balls. With this test it is possible
                  to demonstrate the versatility of this process by having the capability of grabbing objects
                  with curved surfaces. The process held in the first test was
                  replicated four times with the ping pong balls since there were only 5 balls to pick, thus having
                  also a sampling of 20 objects for the experiment.
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Coincidentally, in the second trial, 6 ping pong balls were also not grabbed. However, in
                  this case, the main cause of error resulted from the incorrect determination of the surface’s
                  normal. This is explained by the fact that normal vectors in curved surfaces vary along the
                  object’s surface, unlike flat surfaces in which the normal vectors have all almost the same
                  orientation. From the 6 pieces not grabbed, 3 of them occurred because of this specific issue,
                  like the one in figure <b>2a</b> . Nevertheless, in other times the surface’s normal was poorly
                  determined but since the tool tip got close enough to the surface, the gripper was able to grab
                  the object, as in the case presented in figure <b>2b</b>.
                  The other two issues observed in the first trial were, as expected, also reported in this
                  second experiment. One object was not grabbed because of the incorrect determination of
                  the object’s centroid, presented in figure <b>2c</b>, and the other 2 were due to the incorrect
                  measurement of the distance with the laser sensor, as in figure <b>2d</b>.

              In order to solve the errors in the laser sensor’s readings, firstly, the Arduino, the circuit
              and all the connections, used to receive and interpret the sensor’s output, were placed in a
              box, thus protecting all the connections.

              <img src="img/ControlUnit.png" alt="" width="30%" height="50%"/>
            </center>
            <p>
              Afterwards the laser sensor was
            re-calibrated with another process to ensure that the calibration curve, that links the sensor’s
            distance displayed in its monitor and the reading received by the Arduino, was as precise as
            possible. Since the laser sensor was now attached to the manipulator, contrarily to the first
            time calibrating, it was possible to use the robot’s accuracy to preform a better calibration.
            This time the calibration was held not only with the sensor’s distance displayed in its monitor
            but also with the exact position of the robot’s end effector. So, two linear regressions were
            then computed to evaluate the relation between both these informations with the readings
            received by the Arduino. Both curves are presented in the following figure. Through the Z coordinate of
            the robot’s end effector it is possible to ensure that the collected data is always equally spaced,
            thus obtaining a more precise slope for the calibration curve. Therefore, the equation that
            converts the reading to a distance was altered to include the scope of the linear regression that
            uses the end effector’s coordinates (blue curve in the figure) and the intercept of the curve that
            uses the distance displayed in the sensor’s monitor (red curve in the figure). Consequently the
            Arduino’s code was changed and uploaded.

              After the alteration in the laser sensor’s calibration curve a third test was conducted. In
              this third trial the objects used were eggs, thus demonstrating that this process is sufficiently
              precise to grab fragile objects without deforming or breaking them. The eggs used were
              previously emptied in order to prevent the egg’s content to enter the pipes with compressed
              air, used for the suction, in case of breaking. Consequently, by using empty eggs these will be
              even more fragile and harder to grab without breaking. In third trial the procedure used in the second trial was replicated since there
              were only 5 eggs as well.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Now, from the 20 eggs used in this test 18 were successfully grabbed, and figures <b>3a</b>,
              <b>3b</b> and <b>3c</b> present some of those successes. From the two unsuccessfully grabbed eggs, one
              was due to the incorrect determination of the surface’s normal, presented in figure <b>3d</b>, and
              the other was caused by something not yet witnessed in these trials. Since the eggs become
              lighter when emptied, at the moment the end effector moves closer to more distant objects,
              the suction cup, sometimes, can push those objects when approaching them. This will cause
              situations has the one visualized in figure <b>3e</b>. To solve this problem the suction can be
              activated when the manipulator is approaching the object and not after.

                  was due to the incorrect determination of the surface’s normal, presented in figure 7.8d, and
                  the other was caused by something not yet witnessed in these trials. Since the eggs become
                  lighter when emptied, at the moment the end effector moves closer to more distant objects,
                  the suction cup, sometimes, can push those objects when approaching them. This will cause
                  situations has the one visualized in figure 7.8e. To solve this problem the suction can be
                  activated when the manipulator is approaching the object and not after.
